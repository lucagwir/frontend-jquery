    - Yellow. When Jobs marked show everything as detailed. When clicking on other like Clients show a random image on '/img/service/xx.png'
    - Orage: When Jobs clicked, now have another selection for "Details" and "Report Editor". When details clicked show a random image on '/img/service/xx.png', on the center of the square on where you see noew "Summary" and " Room Items".
    - Green: When on Jobs and report Editor, you have to be able to create new Rooms clicking on the (+) and delete from the (x) red cross.
    - Violet: When a room selected you have to able to create "Summary Items" (below Summary) and "Room Items".
